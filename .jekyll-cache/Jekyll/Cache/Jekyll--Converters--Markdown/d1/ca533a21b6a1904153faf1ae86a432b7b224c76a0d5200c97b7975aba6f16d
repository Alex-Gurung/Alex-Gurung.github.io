I"Ÿ<p>I am a Masterâ€™s student in Computer Science at Georiga Techâ€™s <a href="https://www.ic.gatech.edu/"><strong>School of Interactive Computing</strong></a>, graduating in December 2022. I also did my undergad at Georgia Tech, receiving my BS in CS and minor in Linguistics in December of 2020. Iâ€™m applying for PhD programs with a goal entry in Fall of 2023.</p>

<p>My research lies at the intersections of Computational Social Science and NLP; Iâ€™m particularly interested in 1) how we can leverage NLP techniques to improve online communities and 2) how we can ground large language models with social norms and factual knowledge.</p>

<p>For the past year I have been working as an AI resident at Meta AI where I work on imbuing seq2seq models with commonsense reasoning for use in <a href="https://parl.ai/projects/light/?fbclid=IwAR0BOI-zQ0zIjRM8HCbNB6Hnsipdjmh1KH1ELic3nhy6WAXbINJXwfPI_rU"><strong>LIGHT</strong></a>. The work from that project will hopefully be coming to a conference near you in January! I currently also do work with the <strong>SALT</strong> Lab under Dr. Diyi Yang in combination with Dr. David Muchlinski at the Sam Nunn School of International Affairs.</p>

<p>Previously, I was a machine learning engineer intern at TikTok, and before that I was a software engineer. Iâ€™m always interested in talking about my research and learning more about what other people are doing, feel free to reach out!</p>
