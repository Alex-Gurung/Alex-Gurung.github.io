I am a PhD Student (expected graduation 2026) at the University of Edinburgh's <a href="https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/ilcc"><strong>Institute for Language, Cognition and Communication</strong></a> supervised by Mirella Lapata. My research focuses on improving long-form text generation and analysis for narratives. My most recent work on character-representations, CHIRON, is now <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10190">available on arxiv</a>!


I was previously a Master's student in Computer Science at Georgia Tech's <a href="https://www.ic.gatech.edu/"><strong>School of Interactive Computing</strong></a>, graduating in December 2022. I also did my undergad at Georgia Tech, receiving my BS in CS and minor in Linguistics in December of 2020.


I was also as an AI resident at Meta AI where I <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05746">worked</a> on imbuing LLMs with commonsense reasoning for use in <a href="https://parl.ai/projects/light/?fbclid=IwAR0BOI-zQ0zIjRM8HCbNB6Hnsipdjmh1KH1ELic3nhy6WAXbINJXwfPI_rU"><strong>LIGHT</strong></a>. I have also done work on online radicalization with the <strong>SALT</strong> Lab under Dr. Diyi Yang in combination with Dr. David Muchlinski at the Sam Nunn School of International Affairs. I was also a machine learning engineer intern at TikTok, and before that I was a software engineer.


I'm always interested in talking about my research and learning more about what other people are doing, feel free to reach out!
